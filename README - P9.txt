The intention is to have the user give a specific protein as input in the top search bar.
Based on this input a query will be sent to the database.
The data returned from this query will then be showed to the user.
If no data exist for a given option/value, then it should simply be skipped.
Some of the data will be represented simply as a string of text while other data will be represented as a searchable table.

The sidebar is empty for now, but should be used to give an overview on what the user is currently viewing.
This is needed because the amount of data returned by the query can be quite large.

Currently, there is only a single table holding some example data.
This needs to be replaced by what was mentioned above. Furthermore, this field should be empty at the start.
